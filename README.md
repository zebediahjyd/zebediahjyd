```Howdy! 'tis I! Frivolity at its finest!```

- Something,
- Something,
- Something...
- I got no idea what to say to introduce myself.
- Local narcissist to many?
- Passionate but incredibly socially inept nerd to some.
- Either way, it's all the same.
- I am just another eccentric among eccentrics.
- Merely just one line of paint in a painting of a crowd of people.

*yeahhhhhhhh i got nothin*
